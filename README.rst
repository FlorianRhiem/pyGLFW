pyGLFW
======

This module provides Python bindings for `GLFW <http://www.glfw.org/>`__
(on GitHub: `glfw/glfw <http://github.com/glfw/glfw>`__). It is a
``ctypes`` wrapper which keeps very close to the original GLFW API,
except for:

-  function names use the pythonic ``words_with_underscores`` notation
   instead of ``camelCase``
-  ``GLFW_`` and ``glfw`` prefixes have been removed, as their function
   is replaced by the module namespace
   (you can use ``from glfw.GLFW import *`` if you prefer the naming
   convention used by the GLFW C API)
-  structs have been replaced with Python sequences and namedtuples
-  functions like ``glfwGetMonitors`` return a list instead of a pointer
   and an object count
-  Gamma ramps use floats between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of unsigned shorts
   (use ``glfw.NORMALIZE_GAMMA_RAMPS=False`` to disable this)
-  GLFW errors are reported as ``glfw.GLFWError`` warnings if no error
   callback is set (use ``glfw.ERROR_REPORTING=False`` to disable this,
   set it to 'warn' instead to issue warnings, set it to 'log' to log it
   using the 'glfw' logger or set it to a dict to define the behavior for
   specific error codes)
-  instead of a sequence for ``GLFWimage`` structs, PIL/pillow ``Image``
   objects can be used

Installation
------------

pyGLFW can be installed using pip:

.. code:: sh

    pip install glfw

Windows
~~~~~~~

The GLFW shared library and Visual C++ runtime are included in the Python wheels.

To use a different GLFW library, you can set ``PYGLFW_LIBRARY`` to its location.

macOS
~~~~~

The GLFW shared library for 64-bit is included in the Python wheels for macOS.

If you are using a 32-bit Python installation or otherwise cannot use the
library downloaded with the wheel, you can build and install it yourself by
`compiling GLFW from source <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html>`__
(use ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``).

pyGLFW will search for the library in a list of search paths (including those
in ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH``). If you want to use a specific library, you can set
the ``PYGLFW_LIBRARY`` environment variable to its path.

Linux
~~~~~

The GLFW shared library is included in the Python wheels for Linux.

If you cannot use these on your system, you can install the GLFW shared
library using a package management system (e.g. ``apt install libglfw3``
on Debian or Ubuntu) or you can build and install it yourself by
`compiling GLFW from source <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html>`__
(use ``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``).

pyGLFW will search for the library in a list of search paths (including those
in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``). If you want to use a specific library, you can set
the ``PYGLFW_LIBRARY`` environment variable to its path.

Development Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the development version of GLFW and would like to use wrappers
for currently unreleased macros and functions, you can instead install:

.. code:: sh

    pip install glfw[preview]

or set the ``PYGLFW_PREVIEW`` environment variable.

Note, however, that there will be a slight delay between the development
version of GLFW and the wrappers provided by this package.

Example Code
------------

The example from the `GLFW
documentation <http://www.glfw.org/documentation.html>`__ ported to
pyGLFW:

.. code:: python

    import glfw

    def main():
        # Initialize the library
        if not glfw.init():
            return
        # Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context
        window = glfw.create_window(640, 480, "Hello World", None, None)
        if not window:
            glfw.terminate()
            return

        # Make the window's context current
        glfw.make_context_current(window)

        # Loop until the user closes the window
        while not glfw.window_should_close(window):
            # Render here, e.g. using pyOpenGL

            # Swap front and back buffers
            glfw.swap_buffers(window)

            # Poll for and process events
            glfw.poll_events()

        glfw.terminate()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
